<b>Swing Project</b>
<p>
The Swing project was developed by Brian Cochran with help from Leon Tabak and others in CSC-144. The use of this project is to 
draw various 3-dimensional shapes within a specified window. Prisms, antiprisms, and cones are all able to be drawn with this project 
with configurable height, radius, and side number. The purpose of completing this project is to learn more about how the parts of 
a larger Java program work together and about object oriented programming.
